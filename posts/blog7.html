                New week and I'm back with another devlog (a bit shorter this time). In this devlog we'll see some
                of the new features in Project Movement, and discuss level design and
                movement in the context of some of the feedback we've received after
                releasing <a href="https://project-movement.itch.io/project-movement">Beta 3</a>. There's also a
                <a href="blog7/Project Movement beta3 Presentation.pdf">slideshow presentation</a>
                that goes over some player stats and other details about the release.

            <h3>New Features</h3>
            <p>
                Showing off some of the new stuff this week, we have implemented an animated
                character sprite.<br>
                <img src="blog7/character_anim.gif" alt="the new animated character" loading="lazy"><br>
                And a cool ghost trail effect for the dash ability.
                <img src="blog7/dash_effect.gif" alt="a player character dash right left and up, and when the dash activates a many ghosts are left behind which fade from a light blue hue to a purple-ish one" loading="lazy">
                Speaking of the dash, its implementation has changed yet again. Some day when we have
                a finalized version of the mechanic and I have the will to do it, I'll go in depth on
                creating the dash in Project Movement. Because it is the game's main movement ability, we really
                want it to feel good to use.<br>
                I learned how to add some simple particles in Godot, so now the checkpoints
                give extra visual feedback in addition to auditory feedback when they have
                been activated. <img src="blog7/checkpointglow.gif" alt="a gif of the player coming into contact with checkpoints, upon which they light up and start emitting particles" loading="lazy">
                The Main menu has been changed to no longer use default theming from Godot. I think
                it looks nicer. And in order to better support having more levels we've moved
                the list of levels from the main menu to a dedicated level select screen.

                Three new levels have also been added. Try out the game to see what they look like!
                Their names are: "STARTER," an easier level applying some of the stuff in the tutorial;
                "LETSGO," an experiment with moving hazards and terrain that has turned out to be a bit
                more difficult; and "PILLARS," which is intended to be the most difficult level in the
                game, featuring multiple very precise jumps, small platforms, and hazards abound.

            <h3>Feedback: Levels and Air Control</h3>
            <p>
                We're glad the previous changes we have made (like click to dash and double jump on
                the same key) have eliminated past complaints and points of frustration for players.
                While we haven't gathered a ton of feedback, some of the most common pain points stem
                from the level design and how the movement mechanics interact with it. In a previous
                devlog I may have mentioned that level design is going to be a significant challenge,
                and it certainly is turning out to be. The movement mechanics keep changing since our
                design was never concrete, so it is difficult to make levels that harmonize.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, we receieved feedback about two general cases: first that in "LETSGO"
                it was hard to see where to go, and frustrating to get past the moving obstacles,
                and that in "PILLARS" it too difficult for a game with mechanics like ours.
                In order to address these concerns, we plan to re-evaluate our levels and make
                further adjustments to the parameters of our player movement. Players wanted more
                air control if they were going to be tested by levels like "PILLARS".
            </p>
            <p>
                So far we've covered lateral motion with the dash, keeping it with bunny hopping,
                and added an effective way of moving vertically with the super jump. But there
                is no way to slow down or even stop quickly, which multiple players expressed
                they would like to have after playing "PILLARS". In Source movement, one of the
                inspirations for this game, if the player is moving through the air simply tapping
                in the opposite direction of motion completely halts the character's horizontal
                velocity. When implementing the movement in our game, I thought that this wouldn't
                make sense, and would look pretty weird, so decided against it. But I think I can
                agree that giving the player more air control would be beneficial, at least for slowing down.
            </p>
            <p>
                It shouldn't be hard to do, either. Getting just a little bit technical, we have two parameters of interest in the player
                controller: <code>h_accel_air</code> and <code>max_h_air_influence_speed</code>. One
                controls how fast the player can change their velocity through direction inputs while in the air.
                The other controls the maximum horizontal velocity the player can reach while changing their
                velocity via directional input when in the air. Currently, <code>h_accel_air</code>
                is set to around a tenth of the grounded acceleration, and <code>max_h_air_influence_speed</code>
                is set to around a third of the maximum grounded movement speed.
                So fixing this might be as simple as
                increasing <code>h_accel_air</code> while leaving <code>max_h_air_influence_speed</code>
                unchanged. My concern is, however, that if the player can accelerate quickly in the
                air to slow down, it will feel weird to not be able to accelerate past a smaller
                velocity limit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully that longer discussion illustrates the complexities of movement in
                a game where the whole game is basically just movement. There's a lot of factors to
                consider with each and every mechanic, and no way of telling how players will react
                to them. We're not that good at judging the movement either since while developing the
                game we have gained more familiarity with it and how it is supposed to work.

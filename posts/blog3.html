                This last week of development has been mainly focused on getting some of our ideas for
                movement and movement abilities implemented in Godot. We had a bunch of ideas for
                what movement should look like and what abilities might be interesting, and we have
                implemented a good chunk of them. Our team's development velocity was a bit slower
                over the weekend, but we are looking to make some good progress throughout this next week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since our game will be heavily centered around the experience of controlling a moving
                character, its worth discussing how our current design for how the movement of the character
                looks. Taking inspiration from the speed-focused Source gamemode of Surf, our goal with the
                movement is to have players feel a bit sluggish if just controlling the character, but if they
                make skillful use of the range of abilities, they should be able to traverse through our levels
                very quickly and reach very high speeds.
            </p>
            <p>
                To accomplish this, our player controller/kinematics are more physical in nature. The player's
                motion and velocity is subject to frictions and other accelerations. When these forces aren't present
                (like if the player is soaring through the air), the player character is able to maintain their velocity
                and move very quickly. In order to emphasize use of movement abilities to get around, our player moves
                fairly slowly when just running on the ground. Unlike other platformer games, the player's air
                influence is extremely limited. Platformers normally allow the player to move
                horizontally with similar or slightly less control and freedom than if they were
                grounded. In our game, the player will only have a slight influence on their
                horizontal velocity when in the air, much like the first person Source games that
                we are taking inspiration from for our game's movement and core loop.

                In this devlog: a host of changes based on feedback from in-person testing,
                rewriting the capstone's logging framework in GDSCript, POST request struggles,
                and feedback from public release.

            <h3>Movement Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Addressing the feedback from last week's testers, double jumping while in the air
                was switched to be the same button as regularly jumping from the ground (<kbd>SPACE</kbd>).
                Instead of setting <kbd>W</kbd> to also do a jump, <kbd>W</kbd> now results in a <i>super jump</i>.
                This was implemented to help combat the lack of vertical mobility in the game.

                </figure>
                One of the complaints highlighted in <a href="blog5.html">last week's devlog</a> was that
                it felt difficult to perform walljumps. We found this to be a combination of collisions
                detection with walls in Godot not working as we thought it did, and player tendency
                to hold away from walls when they want to walljump off of them. To address this issue,
                we used <code>RayCast2D</code> nodes on the Player node and checked those
                for collision instead of using the player's kinematic body's <code>is_on_wall()</code>.
                An advantage of this method of checkout for if the player is on a wall or not is that
                it fixes the collision detection issue and solves for players wanting to hold away
                from the wall when trying to walljump. Since air control is minimal in the game,
                the player will still be close enough to the wall for a bit, even if they press the
                opposite direction movement key.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you notice the ray under the player character, this is an experimental change. Again
                in last week's devlog, we covered how players felt having essentially the same actions
                (jump and double jump) on different keys was very confusing. But we were limited in
                changing it because if we did, then it would be really easy for players to use up their
                double jumps without knowing. The ray under the player checks for the ground collisions
                only in the case that the player might want to bunny hop by pressing jump. Unlike the
                wall collision detection, we still use <code>is_on_floor()</code> from Godot's
                <code>KinematicBody2D</code> node. This allows a small margin for the player to still
                bunny hop even when they press the space bar too early.

            <h3>QOL Changes</h3>
            <p>
                These smaller QOL changes were also based on feedback from last week. First, we added
                sound effects to common actions. Jumping, dashing, super jumping, bunny hopping, running,
                dying, leaving the start zone, entering the end zone, and hitting a checkpoint now all have
                sounds associated with them. While the sounds aren't completely cohesive, they do add a
                degree of feedback to the player's actions, which is nice.
            </p>
            <p>
                To address players not knowing when abilities were recharged, we implemented a stopgap fix
                adding the time left to the ability display rather than a binary "yes/no".

            <p>
                Finally, since the game deals with moving fast and moving fast requires a big space to
                move around in, a detached camera mode as been implemented to help players scout ahead.

            <h3>Public Release and Logging</h3>
            <p>
                We released our build to the public on <a href="https://project-movement.itch.io/project-movement">Itch.io</a>, and implemented
                automated logging and data collection. For some analysis and reflection on how that has gone, click <a href="../resources/Project Movement beta presentation.pdf">here</a>
                to see our presentation on it.

            <h3>POST Requests in Godot</h3>
            <p>
                Previous quarters of the Games Capstone here at the UW used a remote logging script
                originally for HaxeFlixel that sends player data to a database server via HTTP POST requests. It logs
                when levels start or end, and associates players with sessions and unique IDs. In
                order to use this logging script, we first ported it to GDSCript and ironed out any
                issues. I tried to keep it as close as a 1:1 rewrite as possible, since we didn't
                know the exact format of data expected by the database server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trying to get the loggin script to work turned out to be very time consuming, and illustrated
                some of the key differences between the original scripts, its many rewrites for
                other engines, and our rewrite. Specifically, it had previously been converted to C#
                for Unity, and a previous quarter's team had rewritten it in JavaScript since they
                were targeting Web release.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main problem that took so long to figure out was just the database server responding with
                <code>{"tstatus":"f","tload":"4"}</code>. I had no clue what this could possibly mean and had
                no access to information about how the database server was running. This didn't give any
                indication of what was actually wrong with the way I was making requests in the GDSCript version
                of the logger. As it turns out, the fix was fairly simple - the server expects <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>
                body data in POST requests. I was already making POST requests, but hadn't realised that
                url-encoding the body data was necessary. This fixed the issue, but was actually really awkward to do in GDSCript.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's get a bit more technical to explore why. In order to simplify the process of making
                HTTP requests in Godot, an <code>HTTPRequest</code> node/class is present in Godot. It wraps
                a <code>HTTPClient</code> node to actually perform the requests. So while it is possible to
                add arbitrary headers to specify that a POST request should be <code>"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</code>,
                there's actually no way to url-encode a request's parameters with <code>HTTPRequest</code>.
                Instead, my code ended up looking like this: <div class="code">func send_post_request(dst: String, parameters: Dictionary) -> HTTPRequest:
	var dummyclient: = HTTPClient.new()

	var req = HTTPRequest.new()
	add_child(req)
	var query_string = dummyclient.query_string_from_dict(parameters)
	var headers = ["Accept: */*",
                   "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"]
	var rescode = req.request(dst, headers, false,
                              HTTPClient.METHOD_POST, query_string)

	return req</div>
                This seems really strange. Even though it shouldn't require any state to url-encode a
                string, the <code>query_string_from_dict</code> is only available on instances of
                <code>HTTPClient</code> in Godot 3.5.2rc2. This is a really awkward and obtuse way of doing stuff,
                and highlights the differences between game engines. Unity's default POST request
                uses <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> and converts dictionaries to the
                right query string format under the hood. The HaxeFlixel and JavaScript versions also
                just make functions calls with what appear to be dictionaries, and have the query string
                conversion automatically performed. Since this wasn't visible in any of the other
                versions of the logging script, that's probably why it took so long to figure out.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                Our struggles with the logging script are not yet finished though. The recommended instructions
                for using it state that "Wait until a response is received before continuing" for our requests
                to initialize a user session and get a user session ID back from the server. But how can this
                be achieved in Godot? I'm still struggling with answering this because there doesn't seem to
                be a way to block all execution but still allow the HTTPRequest we actually want to wait for
                to make progress. <code>OS.delay_msec()</code> blocks all execution so the HTTPRequest can't
                ever get sent. But not doing that means that once we send the request, even if we <code>yield</code>
                to wait for it, control will just transfer to some other node's operations and the game will
                start without waiting. We have verified in the logging data that this is indeed a problem -
                in one case we receive events without a session ID attached and that messes with the quality
                of our data.
            </p>
            <p>
                None of the other resources I can find when Googling need to block the execution of Godot in
                this manner, where it is critical based on the contract of the API to block and not allow
                anything else to happen and generate events that get sent to the server until a response is
                receieved. We might be able to just live with the imperfect data, but if there's anything
                out there floating around, please point me to it.

                In this week of the project's development we made some basic paper prototypes
                for our game. Overall, we felt that it was a good experience, and we got some
                useful feedback from the rest of the teams in the capstone. One thing that
                we learned was that it was especially important to have players understand
                every aspect of the game. Stuff that we had all conceptualized and made concrete
                in our heads was unknown to our players, and often caused confusion. The process
                of teaching the player in the actual game might be something we want to put more
                focus towards since our game will end up dealing with potentially confusing
                movement abilities.

            <p>
                With that out of the way, the last matter for this week was to start development
                of the digital development of Project Movement. We've chosen to use the Godot
                game engine since it seems to be versatile enough for our purposes (making a 2D platformer)
                and looks simple enough to use. We determined that an engine like Unity would be too bulky
                since Unity itself is many GB large, and each of its projects also include a lot of library
                code files. Godot build games for every main platform, so we are confident that it is a
                good choice.
            </p>
            <p>
                We don't have much done yet, but hopefully there are great things to come.

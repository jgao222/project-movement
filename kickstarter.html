                <h3>Project Movement - Source Movement inspired 2D platformer</h2>
                <p>
                    Project Movement is a 2D platformer about going fast, in the tradition of
                    source gamemodes like Bhop and Surf. Where traditional platformers place a hard
                    limit on how fast the player can move, we seek to allow the player to move
                    as fast as possible, in two dimensions.
                </p>

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>
                    Project Movement focuses on inertial movement, where the core goal of the
                    player is to build up speed and keep it through skillful use of movement
                    abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our game will involve using a variety of movement mechanics across multiple
                    levels with hazards and obstacles, creating a plethora of movement contexts.
                    In keeping the Source movement gamemodes, our game features movement across maps
                    with the goal of moving from the start to end zones, while a stopwatch runs and
                    records the player's time.

                <p>
                    At this point in time, the game has already been in development for
                    a while. Though it might not turn out great, we believe that the core
                    of the experience already exists. We recognize that our limited
                    experience as game developers might impede how much polish we will
                    be able to put on it, but our team is all familiar with writing software
                    in general, so we are confident that we will have something that works (and
                    hopefully it will be fun).

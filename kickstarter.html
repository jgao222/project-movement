                <h3>Project Movement - Source Movement inspired 2D platformer</h2>
                <p>
                    Project Movement is a 2D platformer about going fast, in the tradition of
                    source gamemodes like Bhop and Surf (and if you aren't familiar with what
                    those are, the important part is that you go <i>fast</i>). Where traditional 2D platformers place a hard
                    limit on how fast the player can move, we seek to allow the player to move
                    as fast as possible, in two dimensions.
                </p>

                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p>
                    Project Movement focuses on inertial movement, where the core goal of the
                    player is to build up speed and keep it through skillful use of movement
                    abilities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our game will involve using a variety of movement mechanics across multiple
                    levels with hazards and obstacles, creating a plethora of movement contexts.
                    In keeping the Source movement gamemodes, our game features movement across maps
                    with the goal of moving from the start to end zones, while a stopwatch runs and
                    records the player's time.

                <h3>Risks and Challenges (why trust us not to produce vaporware)</h3>
                <p>
                    At this point in time, the game has already been in development for
                    a while. We believe that the core of the experience we are trying to achieve already exists. We recognize our limited
                    experience as game developers, but our team is more than experienced with writing
                    and shipping software in general.

                    Each of the members of our team has years of experience with programming
                    and a refined skillset for designing and developing software systems of
                    roughly this scale, gained through our previous coursework and project experience.

                    We are confident that we will be able to deliver
                    a complete product.
